Introduction:
In the contemporary time, data have become, and they are information which is needing in every decision-making event within any organizational territory. The nature of these components may be different, yet they often are closely related and together contribute to the overall efficiency as well as competitiveness in an enterprise. In this essay we are going to look at the definitions of data, information and knowledge; between them how they play together in an organizational context. This essay only focuses on finance and the impact of intrinsic security attributes connected to that topic, further assessing which part would be most attractive for a threat actor in relation with risk. We look at information security standards like ISO 27001 and the NIST Cybersecurity Framework as well strategies to manage risks proposed governance mechanisms.


Definitions Of Data, Information, Knowledge and their interrelationships:
Data: Data is the raw, unprocessed facts and figures without any specific meaning or context. Data can be of two types one is quantitative whereas another is qualitative which serves as a building block to create information.

Information: Information is the processed data that has been organized , structured, or presented in a meaningful way. Information is the data that has been categorized, calculated and condensed making it useful for decision making processes for the people.

Knowledge: Knowledge is the application and use of information based on the understanding of the relationship between data and information. It is the processed form from multiple sources of information over time and experience.

The interrelationship between these three is that they are dependent on each other as we cannot have information without data and without information there would also not be any knowledge. In the organizational context the interrelation is important in crucial part like decision making, achieving competitive advantage, and to form a strategy.


The Finance Industry:
In the finance industry all of the three data, information, and knowledge are critical in order to operate. Among the three the most important one is the information as it is the most valuable in the finance industry which could also be the  potential threat actor. This is because there are various sensitive and structured information in finance industry such as customer’s financial record, transaction, statements, credit card details and their personal information as well.

Justification: Cybercriminals prize financial information above all else as it is directly tied to value used in further criminal activities (fraud, identity theft and monetary fraud). Financial data, on the other hand, is almost always structured and processed unlike raw unstructured information so it makes for an easier targeted by threat actors. Furthermore, this information can either be sold on the dark web or used to illegally acquire accounts which could result in considerable financial and reputational harm for that company.


Risk Assessment:
After conducting a risk assessment for I have come to identify that following are the threats and vulnerabilities for financial information.

Threats:
Phishing: Cybercriminals may use various methods to trick employees to reveal sensitive financial information.
Insider Threats: Employees or staffs with access to financial information may misuse or leak the sensitive information intentionally or unintentionally.
Malware or Ransomware: Malware can be used to gain unauthorized access to financial system to extract valuable information, while ransomware can encrypt critical information and demand a ransom for its release.

Vulnerability:
Lack Of Encryption: Unencrypted information is vulnerable to interception during transmission or storage.
Weak Authentication Mechanism: Lack of authentication processes can lead to unauthorized access by internal or external threat.
Inadequate Access Controls: Poorly managed access controls may allow unauthorized individuals to access sensitive financial information.


Information Security Standard:
Information Security Standard and framework play a critical role in safeguarding sensitive information. Two widely recognized frameworks are ISO 27001 and the NIST Cybersecurity Framework.

NIST Cybersecurity Framework: The NIST Cyber Security Framework provides a policy framework of computer security guidance for how private sector organizations can assess and improve the ability to protect themselves from cyber attacks. The framework consists of five core functions : Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover.
Application of NIST Cybersecurity Framework:
 For the finance sector this will empower them to build a holistic cybersecurity approach towards protecting financial information using NIST Framework. Through compliance with the framework, organizations can address risks to their data and take steps including encryption or multi-factor authentication as well as good preparation in case of breaches.


Strategies to Minimize Risks:
In order to minimize risk associated with financial information organizations should implement both technical and non-technical measures.
Technical Measures: 
Encryption: Implementation of strong encryption protocols for the data which is being processed or is not being used should remain unreadable if someone without authorization intercepts.

Multi Factor Authentication: There should be various form of security to be verified like password, biometric, or a security token to get the access to the information of finance.

Regular Security Audits: Conducting security audits helps identify vulnerabilities and ensures that the controls are functioning for that reason security audits should be done on regular basis.

Non-Technical Measures:
Employee Training: There should be various training programs conducted in order to train the employees about cybersecurity, phishing awareness, and the importance of the work of information they are working on.

Strict Access Policies: There should be strict policy about the access which ensures only the authorized personnel can have to get the access to the critical information.

 Incident Response Planning: Making a incident response planning can be of help of a big time as the organisation can implement the response plan and control the situation more faster and smoother minimizing the damage on their end.


Governance, Assurance and Control Mechanism:
The term Governance, Assurance and Control Mechanism are essential for managing risk that are connected to financial information but not only for that they also ensure that the security measures are not only implemented but are being well maintained as well.

Governance: Building a governance structure which includes the roles and responsibility clearly for the security of the information that ensure there is accountability at every level of the organisation. The structure should be aligned with the organisation’s objectives and requirement as well.

Assurance: Engaging in independent third party auditors to asses the organisation’s information security will provide an objective evaluation of the effectiveness of the security controls and identifies the area which need some work.
Regular monitoring and reporting on compliance with relevant information security standards will also ensure that the organisation remains compliant abd reduces the risk of legal penalties.

Control Mechanism: Implementing monitoring tools and processes allows the organisation to detect and react to the emergency situation regarding security incident in real time decreasing the opportunity for threat actors.
The another point could be developing and implementing  a risk management framework which includes risk identification, risk assessment, risk treatment, and risk monitoring as it ensures that risk to financial information are systematically managed and mitigated.
Reflection on the Use of AI:
In the process of writing of the essay I have used the help of chat gpt in order to ensure my work goes smoothly and nicely. I have mostly used the AI in order to gather information, develop ideas, and refine my essay.

Prompt Engineering:
“Define data, information, and knowledge in an organizational context”
“What are the main threats to information in the finance industry?”
“How can NIST Cybersecurity Framework be applied in the finance industry?”

The first prompt was used to clarify the definitions and relationships between the three concepts. The initial responses that was given was refined to ensure clarity and relevance.
The second prompt helped with the identification of specific threats and vulnerabilities. The response was critically researched and evaluated to make sure its accurate and is completed.
The third prompt is the summary of the NIST Cybersecurity framework and its application in financial sense. The information was checked against the other sources to validate the corrections.

Critical Evaluation:
For the readability and the base, The essay started from AI generated content that is good in definition of basic terms or identification of threats. But as going through the essay properly there were many limitations in which the AI could do so in order to reach the academic standards researching was needed for further improvement. Whether or not the AI response generated ideas are that helpful I think that it is a good starting point if there was any confusions and start from doing self-research.

AI as a collaborative tool:
The Ai tool was used in order to generate summaries and initial content, which were then expanded upon the additional research and analysis. For example the definition of terms was generated by ai but the examples were supplemented from other sources . In this way the collaborative approach ensured that the essay was done with the help of AI as well as the help of independent research and critical thinking.

Ethical Uses:
The only way to use the AI in the ethical way was not to be solely dependent on it but is to take it as a support and take its knowledge as a supplementary resource. Proper explanation was necessary so that the AI generated ideas were critically assessed and was made sure it fits with the requirement of the assessment.

REFLECTION:
Using of AI in the essay was truly good as it provided me with valuable ideas which I can use in future works. It can be even used to enhance the ideas that are coming in one’s mind. However even though it should be used as an supportive tool many use it to do the full work which is not good as well. Working with Ai also will make you realize that critical evaluation and independent researching is also important as the AI cannot be always correct and it makes mistake. In the end I would like to say that Ai should just be used for supplementary purposes rather than relying on it completely.
