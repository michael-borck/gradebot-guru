    # 2. Get student submissions (depending on interface):
    #   - CLI: Read from file or directory
    #   - GUI: User selects files, drag-and-drop
    #   - Web: Upload via form
    #   - API: Receive submissions via API call

    # 3. Loop through each submission:
    for submission in submissions:
        # 3.1 Extract relevant text (e.g., essay, code)
        # 3.2 Pass text to grader.py
        grade, feedback = gradebot.grader.grade(submission)
        
        # 3.3 Output results (depending on interface):
        #   - CLI: Print to console
        #   - GUI: Display in window
        #   - Web: Show on results page
        #   - API: Return as JSON response
        output_results(grade, feedback)  # Placeholder for actual output logic

    # 4. Clean up (optional, depending on interface and resources used)
