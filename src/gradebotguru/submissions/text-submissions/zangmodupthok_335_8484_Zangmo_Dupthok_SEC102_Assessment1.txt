  In this modern world, data, information, and knowledge  are one of the crucial roles in organization, 
especially for decision -making and strategic planning. Although these terms are interchangeable , they have 
different meanings and interrelationships. This essay will define each term , discussing their importance in 
an organizational context, and impact for organizational success. Additionally, we will focus on the finance 
industry to identify the most  valuable to a potential threat actor, assess risks associated with this component, 
and propose management strategies to reduce  those risks. Furthermore, relevant information security 
frameworks will be discussed, and Governance, assurance, and control mechanisms will also be evaluated.  
1. Definition and Interrelationships  
Data is number or text that does not have any meaning. For example, the number  “20” is a number that 
does not give any information . 
Information is the data that has been processed and  organized to provide meaning ful context . When data 
is analyzed and interpreted, it becomes information that can be used for swift decision -making. For example, 
“Today  is 20th September 2024”  produces useful information.  
Knowledge is the information that has been analyzed based on experience and expertise. Example, 
understanding  that 20th September 2024 is Friday and plans for weekend program.   
The interrelationships among data, information, and knowledge are hierarchical , where  data forms 
foundation, information gives meaningful context  after analyzing , and knowledge provides important level  
of understanding guides.  In an organizational context, these three terms  work together to support decision -
making  and efficient operational. Data is collected and organized  into useful information, and then 
contributes to development knowledge to smooth decision -making and further actions.   
2. Component of value to threat actor: Financial Industry  
In the finance industry, financial transactions and personal information are often considered as sensitive 
data to be handled, where knowledge would be the most valuable component to a potential threat actor. 
This is because knowledge includes critical information about financial systems, operational procedures, 
and strategic plans which can be exploited  for malicious purposes . Threat actors could use knowledge of 
financial systems and procedures to execute complicated attacks  like fraud or insider trading. By accessing financial strategies or blueprints , they could easily manipulate and gain advantages , aiming to disrupt 
financial stability or commit fraud.  
3. Risk assessment  
Insider threats , like  employees or contractors  might misuse  their access to sensitive information for their 
own benefits. External attacke rs may use advanced techniques  to break into the system to access important 
data. Additionally, they might  also trick insiders  into giving  confidential information through  several types  of 
mode , such as offering massive amounts .  
Lack of training makes employees more likely to make mistakes or fall for frauds , because of inadequate 
access , and weak authentication allows unauthorized people to bypass security and access important data. 
These issues can lead to data breaches, fraud, and other security problems. Making the organization  
devastated .  
4. Relevant Information Security Standard or Framework  
ISO 27001 is recognized by the International  Standard Organization (ISO)  for information security 
management, which provides a f ramework for establishing, implementing, maintaining, and improving an 
information security management system (ISMS) , which helps to protect knowledge by requiring 
organizations to conduct regular risk assess ments to identify  and manage vulnerabilities related to sensitive 
knowledge, which helps to understand potential threat s. Moreover,  the standard implements  strict access 
controls to limit who can access and handle critical information, providing role -based access control and 
least privilege controls , ensuring that only authorized personnel can access sensitive information. 
Additionally, ISO 27001 mandates the use of encryption for data , ensuring that knowledge remains 
protected even if the data is stolen.   
5. Management strategies, t echnical and non -technical measures  
To minimize risks associated with valuable knowledge, organizations should implement a combination of 
technical and non -technical measures: In technical measure, one should use role -based access controls 
and ensure that the permissions are granted based on privileges, and regularly review and update access 
permissions. Nevertheless , apply encryption to protect knowledge both during transmission and while storing the data, this helps to prevent unauthorized access and ensures data integrity. Additionally, make 
sure to keep systems and software up to date  with the latest security patches to protect against 
vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers.   
Regarding the non -technical measures, employers  should conduct training sessions for employees  or staff 
to raise awareness about informati on security, and the importance of protecting sensitive information , and 
recognizing potential threats.  Moreover, always develop and maintain a comprehensive incident response 
plan to address and mitigate the impact of security breac hes by regularly testing and updating the plan, 
establ ishing clear policies for the handling, and accessing of sensitive knowledge. Furthermore, ensure that 
all employees understand and work with these policies.  
6. Governance, assurance, and control mechanisms  
Effective governance in information security involves developing and enforcing strong and effective 
information security policies that detail how sensitive knowledge should be managed and protected. These 
policies should be aligned with the industry standards and regulations to ensure secure protection. 
Additionally, executive management should be actively involved in creating and managing security 
strategies, that ensures security m easures are implemented effectively,  and resources are allo cated to 
address  potential risks and vulnerabilities.  
Assurance in information security involves conducting regular security audits to evaluate the effectiveness 
of controls and point out areas which need to be improved. It helps to ensure that security measures are 
working as inten ded and that policies are being followed. Additionally, ongoing compliance monitoring is 
essential to track  information security policie s and standards , also it helps to address any issues of non -
compliance promptly and maintains alignment with security requirements , ensuring that protective 
measures remain effective over time.  
7. GenAI usage guidelines  
a) Prompt Engineering:  
a. Prompt: “What are the differences between data, information, and knowledge in an 
organizational context  in simple word ?” i. Rationale: to obtain clear definitions and to understand the difference between the 
data, information, and knowledge for introducing the essay’s topic in simple words.  
b. Prompt: “What are the common threats and vulnerabilities in the finance industry? Explain 
in simple word. ” 
i. Rationale: to identify potential threats  and vulnerabilities associated with protection 
measures in the finance industry.  
c. Prompt: “How does the ISO 27001 help in protecting critical knowledge in finance 
organizations? Explain in simple word ” 
i. Rationale: To explore more about the specific framework of ISO 27001 in 
protecting knowledge within the organization.  
b) Critical Evaluation:  
Critical evaluation of the AI -generated content on ISO 27001 involved verifying the information against 
official documentation and other secondary sources. While the initial summary accurately covered some of 
the general aspects of ISO 27001, but it somehow  lacked specific examples related to the finance  industry. 
To verify or address this, additional research was conducted to include the examples provided , to give 
relevant analysis for the financ e industry.  
 
 
c) AI as Collaborative Tool:  
I started my essay with an idea from AI, ChatGPT and Claude, which gave me some basic information on 
essay and a summary of ISO 27001. I did extra research from other relevant sources  to add some ideas, 
then I built those ideas combining the AI’s initial information with my own thoughts and findings.   
Using AI tools made my essay process quicker by giving me basic summaries and information on how I 
should start my writing process. This let me spend more time analyzing and applying the ideas. Additionally, 
I checked the AI generated content with other sources and placed it within a wider research context. AI , 
ChatGPT and Claude helped me to understand more about information security and risk management by 
providing clear and organized guidelines in understandable and simple words.  Understanding the differences and interrelationships between data, information, and knowledge is very 
important for effective information security and risk management. In organizations  like finance industry or 
institutions, knowledge is particularly valuable and vulnerable to potential threat actors. To secure it from 
internal or external attacks , implement secure management strategies, adhering to standards like ISO 
27001, and employing governance and control mechanisms for protecting sensitive knowledge a nd 
ensuring the sec urity and integrity of information systems.
