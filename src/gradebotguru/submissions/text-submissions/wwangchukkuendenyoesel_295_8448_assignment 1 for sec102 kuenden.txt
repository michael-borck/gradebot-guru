Data, Information and Knowledge  
 
In today’s digital era, organizations  rely on data, information and kno wledge to make an 
informed decision , maintain a  competitive edge on the market and expand their business.  
Data serves as the foundation,  which is then processed and given context for information 
to be created. This information is used by others with their experience and expertise, to 
transform  into knowledge.  For a company to have a successful business  related to 
groceries , they need to collect the data of the consumer  for each year, analyze  the data to 
understand purchasing patterns of the customer , which can then be used to improve the 
marketing  strategies  needed  to attract more customer and increase the sales of product . 
Data  is raw, unprocessed facts without context. It can include numbers, text, images, or 
any other type of recorded information. For example, ‘12’ is a piece of data that has no 
meaning without additional context.  
Information is data processed, organized, or structured in a way that adds context and 
purpose. It is data made useful  for individuals or systems to interpret, understand, and 
apply it in decision -making processes. For example, “Today’s weather is sunny ” was  raw 
data into useful information by adding context.  
Knowledge  is the application and use of information combined  using  experience, insight, 
and context.  It helps to  understand  the principles behind the information and uses  it to 
make informed decisions, solve problems, and generate new ideas. For example,  Today’s 
weather is sunny where number of visiting the beach or going for a hike  increase for 
number of gears required supplied to customer demonstrates the application of 
knowledge.  
The relationship between data, information and knowledge is arranged on a pyramid with 
data forming the base, information is in the middle and knowledge at the top. The pyramid 
is important for organizations  where their business outcome is based on data is collected, 
information is extracted,  and knowledge is applied to receive a better outcome.  
In the health  industry,  information  would be the most valuable component to a potential 
threat actor. This is because healthcare information, such as patient records, medical  
records , treatment plans,  and bill information  can be exploited for ma licious purposes . 
Unauthorized access to this information can make the victim  lose  their personal and highly sensitive information leading to all sorts  of consequences like identity theft, medical fraud 
and unknown transactions . 
Potential threats:  
• Data breaches  
• Insider threats  
• Phishing attacks  
• Cyberattacks  
Vulnerabilities:  
• Inadequate access controls  
• Unsecured data storage  
• Lack of employee training  
• Outdated security measures  
Information Security Standard: ISO 27001  
ISO 27001 provides a framework for managing information security risks. In healthcare, 
ISO 27001 can be applied to protect patient information by:  
• Implementing access controls and encryption  
• Systematically identify and addressing risk to kn owledge assets  
• Conducting regular risk assessments  
• Establishing procedures  for secure knowledge management  
• Maintain inventory of knowledge assets and their owner  
Management Strategies  
Technical measures:  
• Implementing secure data storage solutions  and access control to allow only 
authorized personnel to gain personal inf ormation  
• Conducting regular security updates  
• Monitor for unauthorized transmission of private knowledge  
• Using encrypts knowledge and strong algorithms for transit  
Non -technical measures:  
• Employee training and awareness programs  
• Provide limited acces s only to those  required roles  
• Establish a culture of security  
• Incident response planning  Governance, Assurance, and Control Mechanisms  
• Establishing a dedicated information security team  
• Develop and maintain the security policies  
• Conducting regular security audits and risk assessments  
• Continuous monitoring to detect potential threat  
• Implementing access control  to protect the patient's information  
• Ensuring sensitive knowledge is identify and handled according to classification  
• Third -party risk management  
 
In conclusion, understanding the interrelationships and importance of data, information, 
and knowledge is crucial for technical, organization  and human factor . In the healthcare 
industry, information is the most valuable component  to protect their assets while 
allowing improved patient care and innovation , implementing ISO 27001, management 
strategies, and governance mechanisms can help protect against potential threats and 
vulnerabilities.  
Prompt Engineering:  
1.Initial Prompt : This prompt helped me to understand the fundamental or basic concept 
for data, information, and knowledge along with their interrelation ships and importances in 
an organizational context.  
I refined this prompt to explore  the application used by industry to promote  their business 
across the marketplace into other nations . 
2.Industry Focus Prompt: This prompt helped me identify the most important component 
requi red for a specific industry where if not managed  properly then all sorts of threats and  
consequences occur.  
I refined this prompt to at least consider  the potential threats and vulnerabilities when 
security isn’t developed,  or security standards not applied.  
3.Risk Assessment Prompt: This prompt helped me to anal yze the potential threats and 
vulnerabilities  when identifying a valuable component for a specific industry.  
I refined this prompt to explore the security standards and frameworks used to prevent 
external and internal threats from access for the organization.  Critical Evaluation:  
I used AI -generated context to gather ideas and summaries for data, information, and 
knowledge along with their inter relationships and importances in an organization. To verify 
the info rmation, I used ChatGPT, Meta AI (Artificial Intelligence) and Perplexity to create an 
essay where I checked each of the source  from the AI  and compared it with each other to 
write my essay.  
Limitations and biases identified are:  
1.The information can be outdated  as it is not up to date with the current data  
2.Provides a different valuable component for the same industry  where each AI gives its 
own answer when solving the same question  
3.It provides little as well as large information when asked the same question   
4.The information is sometime combined and separated for the same topic  when using 
different AI  
AI as Collaborative Tool  
AI-assisted parts:  
• The ideas and summary for importance of data, information and knowledge  
• Identify the potential threats and vulnerability in a specific industry  
• Recommended security standard for managing information security  
Developed further:  
• Additional information provided for security standard and framework  provided in 
simple detail  
• More information for Governance, Assurance and Control Mechanisms  made short  
• Change some points given by the AI in my own words  
Ethical use:  
• Raw, unprocessed facts and figures, such as numbers, words, and observations.  
• In the healthcare industry, knowledge would be the most valuable component to a 
potential threat actor  
• Healthcare knowledge often represents years of research, clinical trials, and 
expertise, making it extremely valuable.  Reflection:  I used Three AI to help me in generating the ideas and summary needed for 
my essay  by writing essay related to data, information and knowledge along with explaining 
their interrelationships and importance in an organizational context. I learned the effective 
way of using AI is search answer in other AI to solve the same question and compare 
between them to understand the knowledge provided by AI. This has impacted me by 
identifying the important points provide d and information written in the ess ay or any sorts 
of information search in the AI and deepened by understanding of the topic.
