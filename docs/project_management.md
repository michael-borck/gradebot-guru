# Project Management

## Overview
This document outlines the project management practices used for the GradeBot Guru project, including the use of GitHub project boards and links to relevant issues.

## GitHub Project Board
We use GitHub Project Boards to manage and track the progress of tasks, issues, and features. The board is organized into columns representing different stages of the workflow, such as "To Do", "In Progress", and "Done".

### Project Board
You can access the GitHub project board [here](https://github.com/your-repo/your-project/projects).

## Issues
Issues are used to track tasks, bugs, and feature requests. Each issue is linked to the project board for better visibility and tracking.

### Creating Issues
- Use the provided issue templates to create new issues.
- Assign the issue to the appropriate column in the project board.

### Example Issues
- [Issue 1: Implement Configuration Loader](https://github.com/your-repo/your-project/issues/1)
- [Issue 2: Setup Logging Configuration](https://github.com/your-repo/your-project/issues/2)
