### ADR: 0010 Emphasising Project Management and Code Consistency

#### Status
Accepted

#### Context
As the project progresses, maintaining a high level of code quality and consistency is essential for readability, maintainability, and collaboration. Establishing good project management practices and coding standards early on can save time and effort in the long run.

#### Decision
We decided to prioritize project management and code consistency by implementing comprehensive documentation, testing, and coding standards.

#### Benefits of Good Project Management and Code Consistency
1. **Improved Readability**: Consistent style and comprehensive documentation make it easier for current and future developers to understand the codebase.
2. **Maintainability**: Clean, well-documented code is easier to maintain and extend.
3. **Reduced Bugs**: Clear documentation and thorough testing (including doctests) help catch and prevent bugs.
4. **Better Collaboration**: Standardized coding practices make it easier for teams to collaborate effectively.
5. **Easier Onboarding**: New developers can get up to speed more quickly with a well-organized and documented codebase.

#### Summary of Recent Tasks
- **Added Doctests**: Provided examples of how functions are used and verified their functionality.
- **Included Type Hints**: Enhanced code readability and enabled better static analysis.
- **Updated Release Script**: Ensured version bumps are categorized properly.
- **Interactive Rebase**: Learned how to amend commit messages to maintain a clear project history.

#### Moving Forward
Here are a few suggestions for maintaining the quality and consistency of the codebase:
1. **Automated Tools**: Set up automated tools like linters (e.g., flake8) and formatters (e.g., Black) to enforce code style.
2. **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Implement CI pipelines to run tests, check code style, and build the project automatically on each commit.
3. **Code Reviews**: Encourage thorough code reviews to maintain quality and consistency across the codebase.
4. **Documentation**: Maintain updated and comprehensive documentation, including usage examples and API references.
5. **Regular Refactoring**: Allocate time for regular code refactoring to address technical debt and improve code quality.

#### Consequences
- **Positive**: 
  - The codebase will be easier to read, maintain, and extend.
  - Reduced likelihood of bugs and issues.
  - Enhanced collaboration among team members.
  - Quicker onboarding for new developers.
- **Negative**:
  - Initial time investment to set up and maintain standards and tools.
