# GradeBot Guru: Systems Requirement Specification

## 1. Introduction

**1.1 Purpose:**  
GradeBot Guru is an AI-powered grading assistant designed to automate the evaluation of student submissions, providing timely and constructive feedback to both students and educators. It aims to streamline the grading process, particularly for large classes or repetitive assignments.

**1.2 Scope:**  
This document details the requirements, architecture, and implementation plan for the GradeBot Guru command-line interface (CLI) application, focusing on its core grading functionality and integration with a Large Language Model (LLM) like Gemini. The initial scope includes grading essays, coding assignments, and quizzes at various educational levels.

**1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations:**
- **LLM (Large Language Model):** An AI model trained on massive amounts of text data, capable of generating human-like text, answering questions, and performing various language-related tasks.
- **Gemini:** A specific LLM developed by Google.
- **CLI (Command-Line Interface):** A text-based interface for interacting with a computer program.
- **PyPI:** The Python Package Index, a repository of software for the Python programming language.
- **LMS (Learning Management System):** Software application for the administration, documentation, tracking, reporting, and delivery of educational courses or training programs.

## 2. Overall Description

**2.1 Product Perspective:**  
GradeBot Guru will be a standalone Python package, installable from PyPI. Users will interact with it primarily through the CLI. Future versions may integrate with Learning Management Systems (LMS).

**2.2 Product Functions:**
- **Grading:** Evaluate student submissions (e.g., essays, code) based on a provided rubric.
- **Feedback:** Generate detailed feedback highlighting strengths and areas for improvement.
- **Configuration:** Allow users to specify the LLM provider and model (initially focusing on Gemini).
- **Customizable Feedback Templates:** Enable users to create and use custom feedback templates.

**2.3 User Classes and Characteristics:**
- **Primary Users:** Educators (teachers, professors) looking to streamline the grading process.
- **Secondary Users:** Students who can benefit from automated feedback.
- **Technical Proficiency:** Users are expected to have basic technical proficiency in using command-line tools.

**2.4 Operating Environment:**
- **Platform:** Any system that supports Python 3.8 or higher (Windows, macOS, Linux).
- **Dependencies:** OpenAI library (or Gemini SDK), other Python packages as needed.

## 3. System Features and Requirements

**3.1 Functional Requirements:**
- **FR1: Load Rubric:** The system shall be able to load a grading rubric from a file (e.g., CSV, JSON with specific headers).
- **FR2: Load Submissions:** The system shall be able to load student submissions from a specified directory, supporting various file types (.txt, .pdf, .md, code files).
- **FR3: Generate Prompt:** The system shall generate a well-formatted prompt for the LLM, including the submission, rubric, and any additional instructions.
- **FR4: Interact with LLM:** The system shall send the prompt to the LLM and receive its response.
- **FR5: Parse Response:** The system shall extract the grade and feedback from the LLM's response, handling multiple grading criteria and weights.
- **FR6: Output Results:** The system shall display the grade and feedback in the CLI.

**3.2 Non-Functional Requirements:**
- **NFR1: Accuracy:** The grading results should be consistent with the rubric and reflect the quality of the submission, within a 10% variance compared to human grading.
- **NFR2: Performance:** The system should process submissions in a reasonable amount of time (e.g., grading each submission within a few seconds).
- **NFR3: Usability:** The CLI should be intuitive, easy to use, and accessible (compatible with screen readers).

## 4. System Design

**4.1 Architecture:**
- **Modules:**
  - `gradebotguru`: Main package containing the core application logic (e.g., `main.py`, `grader.py`).
  - `llm_interface`: Package responsible for interacting with the LLM (e.g., `api.py`, `prompts.py`).
  - `logging`: Module for logging interactions and errors.
- **Data Flow:**
  1. The `main.py` module reads submissions and the rubric.
  2. The `grader.py` module generates prompts and passes them to the `llm_interface`.
  3. The `llm_interface` interacts with the LLM API.
  4. The `grader.py` module parses the LLM response and displays the results in the CLI.
  5. The `logging` module records interactions and errors.

**4.2 Technologies:**
- **Programming Language:** Python 3.8+
- **LLM:** Gemini (initially), with a modular design to support multiple LLMs in the future.
- **Other Libraries:** `argparse` (for CLI), `json` and `csv` (for file handling), `logging` (for error management), `unittest` or `pytest` (for testing).

## 5. Implementation Plan

1. **Implement LLM Interface:**
   - Create the `llm_interface` module.
   - Implement functions to interact with the Gemini API, including error handling and a fallback mechanism.

2. **Implement Core Grading Logic:**
   - Create the `grader.py` module.
   - Implement the `grade` function to handle prompt generation, LLM interaction, and response parsing.

3. **Build CLI:**
   - Implement the `main.py` module.
   - Use `argparse` to handle command-line arguments.
   - Integrate with the `grader.py` and `llm_interface` modules.

4. **Testing:**
   - Create unit tests for each module.
   - Include integration tests to ensure modules work together correctly.
   - Test the CLI with sample submissions and rubrics.
   - Plan for user acceptance testing (UAT) with a sample user group.

5. **Packaging:**
   - Use Poetry to build and package the application.
   - Document the packaging process thoroughly.

6. **Deployment:**
   - Set up continuous integration (CI) pipelines for automated testing and deployment.
   - Publish the package to TestPyPI for initial testing.
   - Once stable, publish to the main PyPI repository.

## 6. Appendix (Optional)
- Include detailed examples of rubrics, submissions, and LLM prompts.
- Provide instructions for setting up the development environment.
- Include user documentation and quick start guides for new users.
- Include any additional technical specifications or constraints.

## Additional Considerations

**Security and Privacy:**
- Address how student data and submissions will be handled securely.
- Ensure compliance with relevant data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, FERPA).

**Scalability:**
- Plan for handling a large number of simultaneous submissions.
- Consider cloud deployment options for scalability.

**User Feedback and Improvement:**
- Implement a feedback mechanism for users to report issues and suggest improvements.
